## JAMstack Migration

JAMstack is gaining traction as the speed, ease and inherent security of static websites has become more apparent.

This blog has changed domain and platform several times, and the latest incarnation is built on Hugo.

Mostly I will just be updating the content in the Wiki rather than posting news.
