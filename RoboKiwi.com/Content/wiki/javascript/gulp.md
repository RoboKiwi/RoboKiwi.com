## Overview

Gulp is a JavaScript build tool.

It revolves around piping input streams through one or more tasks.

As an example, you could have a Gulp file that will take in all your application's javascript files, concatenate them into a single file, run JSLint, generate sourcemaps, minify and place the resulting file in your release folder.

Having such a powerful and simple build tool allows you to develop your web application in clean, modular code while allowing you to create a simple to deploy and load release.

> Gulp and similar tools like Grunt has been superseded by Webpack
