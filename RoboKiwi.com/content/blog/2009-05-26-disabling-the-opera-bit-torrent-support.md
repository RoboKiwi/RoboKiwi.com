Opera has built-in torrent support which is very handy and nice, but not quite as nice as a full-fledged client like <a title="ÂµTorrent - The Lightweight and Efficient BitTorrent Client" href="https://www.utorrent.com/" target="_blank">uTorrent</a>

To disable the Torrent support in Opera so that uTorrent or your default torrent client will be used instead:

* In Opera, type in *opera:config* in the address bar and hit enter
* Click the Bit Torrent section to expand it
* Untick **Enable**
* Hit **Save**
* Click **OK** at the message box

You *won't* have to restart Opera for this change to take effect
