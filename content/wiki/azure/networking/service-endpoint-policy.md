title: Service Endpoint Policies
---

## Overview

You can use Service Endpoint Policies to restrict resource access.

For example, you could ensure that resources in a particular subnet are only allowed to access a particular storage account; this can prevent scenarios such as data exfiltration by a resource taking data from a protected resource, and then simply exfiltrating that data into an unprotected resource.
