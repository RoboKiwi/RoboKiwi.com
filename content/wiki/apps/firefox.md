# User Styles

Enable user styles by going to `about:config` and finding the `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` setting, and toggling it to `true`.

Open up the Troubleshooting page to find your user profile location (hit `ALT` > `Help` > `Troubleshooting Information`, or `Hamburger Menu` > `Help` > `Troubleshooting Information`).

Find the `Profile Folder` setting and click `Open Folder`

Create a `chrome` sub folder, and in here you can create your `userContent.css`.
