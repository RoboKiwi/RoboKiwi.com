Hamilton has applied a bunch of patches and fixes to the Castle Project for the Components and Windsor sub-projects. Including 2 minor and insignificant patches that I submitted +D. It's good to feel part of a major Open Source project, even for a small contribution.

> During the holiday – and between Wow quests and dungeons – I’ve managed to apply a bunch of patches and to fix some outstanding bugs on the Components and Windsor projects.
> 
> Another interesting accomplishment is some contributions finally made in and Castle.Core, Castle.MicroKernel and Castle.Windsor are now Silverlight ready.
> 
> Last but not least, I recently applied a patch that made Castle.DynamicProxy 2 also available for Silverlight.
> 
> The pending items now are:
> 
> - Fix the build so the bits targeting SL will be correctly build and made available through our build server
> 
> - Change Windsor to use the SL version of DynProxy.
> 
> Thanks for all the patches, people. Keep them coming! :)

While I'm currently focusing my efforts on ASP.NET MVC and moved away from MonoRail, I use Castle extensively in my .NET projects, particularly ActiveRecord and Windsor/MicroKernel.
